# SVGPieChart
An SVG and JavaScript Pie Chart <br />

Inspired by Mark Caron's Donut chart at https://medium.com/@heyoka/scratch-made-svg-donut-pie-charts-in-html5-2c587e935d72  <br />
Pies! - to go with the beers! : D   <br />

The colours are random and change when the page is refreshed. <br />
They can be fixed by adding a 'color' property to each entry in the JSON file: <br />
ie. 

 { ...,    
  "color":"#00ff00"    
 }   
 or "rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3)" for example - (low opacity of 0.3 for pastel shades here). <br />
